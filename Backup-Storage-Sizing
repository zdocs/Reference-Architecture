= Backup Storage Sizing
Most customers require the ability to restore messages up to 30 days old from backup. This means there should be up to 5 weeks of email data.
Zimbra does what is effectively a differential backup in order to achieve the functionality of a full backup. A "differential" backup works by hard linking message files that were already backed up in a previous backup and only copying new message files. So each full backup directory is self-contained, and the total number of copies of messages in the backup at any time is 1, irrespective of the number of Full Backups that are being retained.
Size of full backup = size of primary store + size of secondary store + size of MySQL db + size of Index.  It will grow at the exact same rate as the live data.  
The total size required for backups is estimated in tables 3 and 4 for the mailbox and archive server in the row shown as /opt/zimbra/backup.

= Glossary 

The Glossary lists terms and acronyms used in this document, and includes both industry terms and application-specific terms.

A record: A (Address) records map the hostname to the numeric IP address. For Zimbra,
the A record is the IP address for the zimbra server.

Account Policy: Class of Service as exposed in Zimbra administration console.

AD: Microsoft Active Directory Server. Used in Zimbra as an optional choice for authentication and GAL, along with OpenLDAP for all other Zimbra functions.

Alias: An “also known as” email address, which should be routed to a user at a different email address.

Attribute: Contains object-related data for directory server entries. Attributes store information such as a server host name or email forwarding address.

Authentication: Process by which user-supplied login information is used to validate that user’s authority to enter a system.

Blacklist: Anti-spam term, indicates a known bad IP address. This could be one that has been hijacked by spammers, or also one from a poorly maintained but legitimate site that allows mail relaying from unauthorized parties.

Class of Service (COS): Describes an object in the Zimbra LDAP data schema, which contains settings for things like user mail quotas. Each Zimbra account includes a COS, and the account inherits all the settings from the selected COS.

CLI: Command-Line Interface, used to refer to the collective set of Zimbra command line tools, such as zmprov.

Cluster: A type of network configuration for high availability, using clusters of servers (nodes). If one server fails or drops off the network, a spare takes over.

Contacts: Within Zimbra, Contacts are a user-interface feature listing that user’s personal collection of address and contact information.

Conversation: Within Zimbra, Conversations are a user-interface feature that presents email threads (emails sharing the same subject line) as a single Conversation listing. Users can expand the Conversation to view all emails within it.

DHTML: Dynamic HTML. A technology employed in the Zimbra Web Client.

DMZ: Demilitarized Zone, redundant servers located in an Internet-facing security zone.

DNS: Domain Name System, an Internet directory service. DNS is how domain names are translated into IP addresses and DNS also controls email delivery. Correctly configured DNS is required for Postfix to route messages to remote destinations

Edge MTA: Generic term used to refer to any mail transfer agent that is the first line of defense in handling incoming email traffic. Functions that may occur on the Edge MTA include spam filtering.

Entry: An item in the directory server, such as an account or mail host.

Failover: Takeover process where a spare server machine detects that a main server is unavailable, and the spare takes over processing for that server.

FQDN: Fully qualified domain name. The hostname and the path to the host. For example, www.Zimbra.com is a fully qualified domain name. www is the host, Zimbra is the second-level domain, and .com is the top level domain.

GAL: Global Address List, the Outlook version of a company directory. Lists contact information, including email addresses, for all employees within an organization.

Global Configuration: A Zimbra object containing default settings for servers and Class of Service.

HA: High Availability. Refers to the availability of resources in a computer system in the wake of component failures in the system.

HSM: Hierarchical Storage Management. Data storage that automatically moves data between high-cost and low-cost storage media.

HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol, used along with SOAP for UI integration.

IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol is a method of accessing mail from a remote message store as if the users were local.

Indexing: The process of parsing incoming email messages for search words.

Java: Java is an industry standard object-oriented programming language. Used for the core Zimbra application server.

JavaScript: Scripting largely developed by Netscape that can interact with HTML source code.
Technology used in the Zimbra Web Client.

LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, an industry standard protocol used for authentication.

LMTP: Local Mail Transfer Protocol, used for transferring messages from Postfix MTA to the Zimbra server for final delivery.

Mail Store: Within Zimbra, a directory area that stores all the indexing information for mail messages on a particular mailbox server.

MAPI: Messaging Application Programming Interface, a system built into Microsoft Windows to enable 100different email applications to work together.

Message Store: Within Zimbra, a directory area that stores the mail messages on a particular mailbox server.

MDA: Mail Delivery Agent, sometimes known as a mail host. The Zimbra server functions as an MDA.

Metadata: Data that describes other data, rather than actual content. Within Zimbra, metadata consists of user folders, threads, message titles and tags, and pointers.

MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, a specification for formatting non-ASCII Internet message content such as image files. Format used to store messages in Message Store.

MTA: Message Transfer Agent, a program that delivers mail and transports it between machines. A Zimbra deployment assumes both the Postfix MTA and an edge MTA.

MX Record: Mail eXchange. An MX record is an entry in a domain name database that identifies the mail server that is responsible for handling emails for that domain name. The email system relies on DNS MX records to transmit emails between domains. When mail is processed, the MX record is checked before the A record for the destination address.
Open Source: Refers to software created by groups of users for non-commercial distribution, where source code is published rather than proprietary.

NUMA: Non-Uniform Memory Access, a computer memory design where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to a processor.

Zimbra has the ability to archive all inbound and outbound messages for a designated mailbox to a separate archive mailbox. The Archiving and Discovery Zimlet will be installed on the mailbox server and the service will be enabled on the MTA/Proxy server to support archiving and discovery if this is required.
